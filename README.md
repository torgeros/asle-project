## Steps for current setup

- clone repo
- open eclipse with workspace as repo root
- import `basicfamily`, `.edit` and `.editor`
- open `basicfamily/model/*.genmodel`
  - right click top level entry, "generate model"
- right click on `basicfamily` project (side bar), run as, eclipse application

Eclipse should open with `basicfamily.sample` and `my.family.design`. The first contains the to-be-shown `*.basicfamily`-file and the diagram representation. The latter contains the diagram specification, i.e., the `.odesign`-file that translate metamodel into diagram.
